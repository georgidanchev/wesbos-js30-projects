#wesbos-js30-project

These are the 30 projects I completed based on the short javascript30 course by Wes Bos ([link](https://www.javascript30.com/)). This is my second time completing this course and you may notice that there aren't 30 folders in this repo. Yes, some of the projects were merged some were re-ordered and the webcam one wasn't completed, as I didn't have a webcam to test. 

After this course I moved on to his advanced [ES6 course](https://es6.io/). I went through it twice as well, and on my second go, I made some detailed notes. There would not be a public repo of this project, as it was all about ES6 coding functions and way of coding, no actual projects were done in that course, which was a bit disappointing, but I still learned a ton! If you are interested in my notes, ask me about them. I will reformat and publish them later on, once I clear my huge to-do list.
